# SvelteKit âž• Pocketbase

Simple setup for SK and PB.
For me to save in one spot and reuse as needed.

1. Run a `npm create svelte@latest web` in this folder (or another name and rename it "web").
Assumes the project will be "Typescript".
2. Add tailwind to your web project. `npm add -D postcss tailwindcss autoprefixer` and `npx tailwindcss init`.
(in the web folder you just created)
3. Copy the files from the `[web]` folder into the correct spots inside `web/src`.
Since this is a boilerplate and not a package, there's less I go into about setup.
These files should be customized to fit your project.

## more stuff

You need to set `PUBLIC_DATABASE` in your environment.
The docker-compose.yml I included, I use for production and have `PUBLIC_DATABASE` set to the internal docker url.
However, during dev, I'll throw a pocketbase.exe in the db folder and set `PUBLIC_DATABASE` to 'http://localhost:8090' to keep things smooth.

Change the `.github/workflows/main.yml` to work with your production environment.
It's setup to workflow_dispatch, so change it for on: push: [main] or what have you.

Delete the `[web]` folder after merging with `web`.
I didn't want to commit a SvelteKit init to this repo as I prefer to run the init on each new project.

## setup

You can run setup.mjs (setup.sh and setup.cmd are just wrappers) to initialize everything.
It'll download a copy of pocketbase to .\db, run through the sveltekit installation, setup tailwind and @sveltekit/adapter-node, copy the [web] files over, setup a fresh .git, and remove the setup files.
Should leave you ready to go.

## ssr

My projects tend to focus on SSR.
This boilerplate will prioritize SSR as most projects will have the Pocketbase URL only on localhost.
However, I recently needed realtime so I added it to the mix.
If you want to protect your database: change the PUBLIC_DATABASE envvar to DATABASE, remove `httpOnly` from hooks.server, and remove hooks.client + lib/pocketbase/client.
